{TITLE}

[quantum-circuit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quantum-circuit) is open source quantum circuit simulator implemented in javascript. Smoothly runs 20+ qubit simulations in browser or at server (node.js). You can use it in your javascript program to run quantum simulations. Circuit can be imported from and exported to [OpenQASM](https://github.com/Qiskit/openqasm). You can export circuit to [pyQuil](http://docs.rigetti.com/en/latest/index.html), [Quil](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03355), [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/documentation/), [Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq) and [QuEST](https://quest.qtechtheory.org/), so it can be used for conversion from OpenQASM to other languages. Circuit drawing can be exported to [SVG](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) vector image.

# Getting started

## Create circuit

Create instance of `QuantumCircuit` class, optionally passing number of qubits (wires) to constructor:

```javascript
var circuit = new QuantumCircuit(3);
```
*Note: number of qubits is optional argument - circuit will expand automatically if you add gates to non-existing wires*


## Add single-qubit gates

Call `addGate` method passing gate name, column index and qubit (wire) index:

```javascript
circuit.addGate(gateName, column, wire);
```

For example, to add Hadamard gate as a first gate (column 0) at second qubit (wire 1) type:

```javascript
circuit.addGate("h", 0, 1);
```

Result is:

```
                  
         Column 0 
                  
Wire 0 -----------
                  
          |---|   
Wire 1 ---| H |---
          |---|   
                  
```

*Note: if `column` is negative integer then gate will be added to the end of the wire*


## Add multi-qubit gates

Call `addGate` method passing gate name, column index and array of connected qubits (wires):

```javascript
circuit.addGate(gateName, column, arrayOfWires);
```

For example, to add CNOT as a second gate (column 1) controlled by second qubit (wire 1) at third qubit as target (wire 2) do:

```javascript
circuit.addGate("cx", 1, [1, 2]);
```

```
                                
         Column 0    Column 1   
                               
Wire 0 ------------------------
                               
                               
Wire 1 -----------------o------
                        |      
                     |-----|   
Wire 2 --------------| CX  |---
                     |-----|   
                               
```

*Note: if `column` is negative integer then gate will be added to the end*


## Example - Quantum random number generator

```javascript

var QuantumCircuit = require("quantum-circuit");

//
// 8-bit quantum random number generator
//

var quantumRandom = function() {

    var circuit = new QuantumCircuit();

    for(var i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        //
        // add Hadamard gate to the end (-1) of i-th wire
        //
        circuit.addGate("h", -1, i);

        //
        // add measurement gate to i-th qubit which will store result 
        // into classical register "c", into i-th classical bit
        //
        circuit.addMeasure(i, "c", i); 
    }

    // run circuit
    circuit.run();

    // return value of register "c"
    return circuit.getCregValue("c");
};

// Usage - print random number to terminal
console.log(quantumRandom());

```


## Implemented gates

{GATE_INDEX}

*For more details see [gate reference](#gates)*


## Run circuit

Simply call `run` method.

```javascript
circuit.run();
```

## Initial state

By default, initial state of each qubit is `|0>`. You can pass initial values as array of bool (`true` or `false`) or integers (`0` or `1`). This will set first two qubits to `|1>` and evaluate circuit:

```javascript
circuit.run([1, 1]);
```


## Measurement

Method `probabilities()` will return array of probabilities (real numbers between 0 and 1) for each qubit:

```javascript
console.log(circuit.probabilities());
```

Method `probability(wire)` will return probability (real number between 0 and 1) for given qubit:

```javascript
console.log(circuit.probability(0));
```

Method `measureAll()` returns array of chances (as integers 0 or 1) for each qubit:

Example:
```javascript
console.log(circuit.measureAll());
```

Method `measure(wire)` returns chance (as integer 0 or 1) for given qubit:

Example:
```javascript
console.log(circuit.measure(0));
```

You can store measurement into classical register. For example, to measure first qubit (wire 0) and store result into classical register named `c` as fourth bit (bit 3):

```javascript
circuit.measure(0, "c", 3);
```

You can add `measure` gate to circuit and then measurement will be done automatically and result will be stored into classical register:

```javascript
circuit.addGate("measure", -1, 0, { creg: { name: "c", bit: 3 } });
```

Short form of writing this is `addMeasure(wire, creg, cbit)`:

```javascript
circuit.addMeasure(0, "c", 3);
```

*Note:*

- *Measurement gate will reset qubit to measured value only if there are gates with classical control (gates controlled by classical registers). Otherwise, measurement gate will leave qubit as is - measured value will be written to classical register and qubit will remain unchanged. This "nondestructive" behavior is handy when experimenting. However, it will automatically switches to "destructive" mode when needed (when classical control is present)*

- *If specified classical register doesn't exists - it will be created automatically.*


## Classical registers

**Create register**

Classical registers are created automatically if you add measurement gate to the circuit but you can also manually create registers by calling `createCreg(name, len)`.

Example: create classical 5-bit register named `ans`:
```javascript
circuit.createCreg("ans", 5);
```

**Read register**

To get register value as integer, call `getCregValue(name)`.

Example:
```javascript
var value = circuit.getCregValue("ans");
```

**Read all registers as dictionary**

```javascript
var regs = circuit.getCregs();
console.log(regs);
```

**Read all registers as tab delimited CSV string**

```javascript
var tsv = circuit.cregsAsString();
console.log(tsv);
```

**Read single bit**

Example: get bit 3 from register named `ans`:

```javascript
console.log(circuit.getCregBit("ans", 3));
```
*Returns integer: 0 or 1*


**Set single bit**

Example: set bit 3 to `1` in register named `ans`:

```javascript
circuit.setCregBit("ans", 3, 1);
```

## Control by classical register

Each quatum gate in the circuit (except "measure" gate) can be controlled by classical register - gate will be executed only if classical register contains specified value. Pass `options` object as fourth argument to `addGate` method:

Example:
```javascript
circuit.addGate("x", -1, 0, { 
    condition: { 
        creg: "ans",
        value: 7
    }
});
```
In this example, "x" gate will execute on qubit 0 only if value of register named "ans" equals 7.


## Reset qubit

You can reset qubit to value `|0>` or `|1>` with `resetQubit` method:

```javascript
circuit.resetQubit(3, 0);
```
In this example, qubit 3 will be set to `0|>`. 

*Note that all entangled qubits will be changed as well*


## View/print state vector

You can get state as string with method `stateAsString(onlyPossible)`:

```javascript
var s = circuit.stateAsString(false);
```

If you want only possible values (only values with probability > 0) then pass `true`:
```javascript
var s = circuit.stateAsString(true);
```


Or, you can print state to javascript console with method `print(onlyPossible)`:

```javascript
circuit.print(false);
```

If you want to print only possible values (only values with probability > 0) then pass `true`:
```javascript
var s = circuit.print(true);
```


## Save/Load circuit

You can export circuit to javascript object (format internally used by QuantumCircuit) by calling `save` method:

```javascript
var obj = circuit.save();

// now do something with obj, save to file or whatever...

```

And load previously saved circuit by calling `load` method:

```javascript
var obj = // ...load object from file or from another circuit or whatever

circuit.load(obj);

```


## Use circuit as a gate in another circuit

You can "compile" any circuit and use it as a gate in another circuit like this:

```javascript
// export circuit to variable
var obj = someCircuit.save();

// register it as a gate in another circuit
anotherCircuit.registerGate("my_gate", obj);

// use it as a gate in another circuit
// assuming original circuit has three qubits then gate must spread to 3 qubits, in this example: 2, 3, 4)
anotherCircuit.addGate("my_gate", 0, [2, 3, 4]);

```


## Decompose circuit

If your circuit contains user defined gates (created from another circuit), you can decompose it into equivalent circuit containing only basic gates.

If you pass `true` as argument to function `save`, you'll get decomposed circuit.

Example:
```javascript
var obj = circuit.save(true);
// now obj contains decomposed circuit. You can load it:
circuit.load(obj);
```

# Export circuit

## Export to JavaScript

Circuit can be exported to JavaScript with `exportJavaScript(comment, decompose)` method:

Example:
```javascript
var js = circuit.exportJavaScript("Comment to insert at the beginning.\nCan be multi-line comment like this one.", false);
```

- `comment` - comment to insert at the beginning of the file.

## Export to python (Qiskit)

Circuit can be exported to [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/documentation/) with following limitation:

- User defined gates are not generated. Instead, circuit is decomposed to basic gates and exported. Effect is the same but code is less readable. **TODO**

- Gates not directly supported by Qiskit are exported as-is - their definition is not generated. **TODO**

To export circuit to Qiskit use `exportQiskit(comment, decompose, null, versionStr)` method:

...

``` 


## Export to Quirk

Circuit can be exported to popular open-source drag-and-drop quantum circuit simulator [Quirk](https://algassert.com/quirk) with following limitations:

- Quirk doesn't support more than 16 qubits.

- Quirk can possibly incorrectly interpret circuit if we have multiple controlled gates in the same column.

- Quirk doesn't support non-sequentially positioned multi-qubit user-defined gates (for example gate on wires [3, 0, 1]) so it's best to export decomposed circuit.


Example:

```javascript

var quirkData = circuit.exportQuirk(true);

var quirkURL = "http://algassert.com/quirk#circuit=" + JSON.stringify(quirkData);

// Now do something with quirkURL. Assuming this code runs in browser and we have <a id="quirk"></a> somewhere, you can:
var quirkLink = document.getElementById("quirk");
quirkLink.setAttr("href", quirkLink);

```


# About simulator algorithm

Memory usage: up to `2 * (2^numQubits) * sizeOfComplexNumber`


- Naive implementation stores entire state vector in an array of size `2^numQubits`. We are storing state in a "map", and only amplitudes with non-zero probabilities are stored. So, in worst case, size of state map is `2^n`, but it's less most of the time because we don't store zeroes.

- Naive implementation creates transformation matrix and multiplies it with state vector. We are not creating and not storing entire transformation matrix in memory. Instead, elements of transformation matrix are calculated one by one and state is multiplied and stored in new state map on the fly. This way, memory usage is minimal (in worst case we have two `2^n` state vectors at a time).

- Algorithm is parallelizable so it could use GPU, but GPU support is not implemented yet (work in progress).
